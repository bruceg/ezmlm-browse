.B ezmlm-browse-conf
[
.B \-\-apache

.B \-\-setuid
]
.I DESTPATH TARGET.cgi [ LISTPATH HOSTNAME ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program sets up the necessary links and programs to use
.B ezmlm-browse
on a web server.
.P
.I DESTPATH
is the path into which the files should be installed.  This is
necessarily a directory which the web server can access.
.I TARGET.cgi
is the filename for the CGI script in the target directory.  This will
frequently be
.I index.cgi
if there is nothing else in the directory.  A sample configuration file
is written to the destination directory if it is not already present.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-apache
Create an Apache
.B .htaccess
configuration file in the destination.
.TP
.B \-\-setuid
Install a setuid CGI wrapper in the destination (instead of the usual
startup script) in order to allow
.B ezmlm-browse
to read the archive files.  This is useful if the archive files are
owned by a different user than the web server and Apache suexec (or
equivalent) is not in use.
