Building the Sources
====================

- Unpack the ezmlm-browse sources into a non-web-visible directory.  If
  you are using the setuid wrapper (see below), this is the directory
  from which ezmlm-browse will execute.

- Make sure all the conf-* files have values appropriate for your
  system (they contain notes about what they are used for).  They are
  set to appropriate defaults for most systems using GCC.

- If your python program is not in the path, put the full path to it in
  the first line of a file called "auto-python".
  If in doubt, skip this step.

- Run "make".

Simple Installation
===================

- As a user that has read access to the list archives, run:

  ./ezmlm-browse-setup --apache DESTPATH TARGET.cgi

  where: DESTPATH is the destination directory into which the files will
  be installed, TARGET.cgi is the CGI filename to install.  For the
  simplest usage this target will be "index.cgi", but if you have other
  CGI scripts in the same directory you may name it something else.

Generic Installation
====================

- Copy either "ezmlm-browse" (if your web server is using Apache suexec
  or equivalent) or "wrapper" (for setuid execution) into a location
  where CGI programs may be executed.  Usually this is either something
  in a "cgi-bin" directory or a file elsewhere named "something.cgi".
  The destination name does not need to be either "wrapper" or
  "ezmlm-browse" as the script will automatically determine its own name
  for the links it creates.

- Make sure the resulting program is executable and owned by the a that
  has read access to the list archives.

- If your web server runs as a user that cannot read the mailing list
  archives (normally true) and does not use the Apache suexec or
  equivalent module, make the copy of the "wrapper" program setuid to a
  user that has read access to the mailing list archive files.  Do *NOT*
  make any Python script setuid.

- Copy in the "ezmlm-browse.ini" file and edit it as appropriate for
  your site and lists.

- If using Apache with the program in a directory other then "cgi-bin",
  make sure CGI execution is enabled in that directory by adding the
  following lines to a ".htaccess" file in the same directory:

	Options +ExecCGI
	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
	DirectoryIndex index.cgi

  Other server software should be similarly configured.

Configuration
=============

- Edit ezmlm-browse.ini in the destination directory to declare which
  mailing lists are visible to the web, and set the other defaults as
  appropriate.

- Mailing lists should have the ezmlm-make "-i" option enabled to keep
  the necessary indices up to date.  If this is not enabled, run the
  following command for each list:

	ezmlm-make -+ -i /path/to/list
