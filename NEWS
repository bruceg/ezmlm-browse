Changes in version 0.9

- Two bugfixes in the handling of month numbers from "Central Linux
  Experts And Newbies" via Gerrit Pape.
- Some HTML template bugfixes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8

  the HTML templates.  This means less flexability in the templates, but
  faster code and easier maintenance and templating.
- Now has author indices, paging, more links, time zone management,
  style configuration, and other features I've forgotten.
- The default template is marked up with CSS classes in many places, and
  three sample style sheets are included.

- Added new built-in functions for producing relative links in the
  templates: relink and cmdlink.
- Rewrote the templates to merge all the common header and footer data
  into a single file.
- Added a parse tree optimizer to the template system which removes body
  elements consisting of a single node.
- Pre-compile all template expressions before use to speed up looped
  execution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.5

- Totally rebuild the template system, moving most of the actual
  page-specific code into the template pages themselves.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.2

- Added proper targets to build the compiled Python bytecode files.

- Replaced the Python main routine with a C wrapper that is suitable for
  installations where setuid operation is required.
