Upgrading from version 0.13 or earlier
--------------------------------------

In version 0.20, the configuration file changed from a Python source
config.py to an INI file named ezmlm-browse.ini.  You will need to
create this file as appropriate.

Upgrading from version 0.11 and earlier
---------------------------------------

In version 0.12, the location of the static files (stylesheets and
icons) was moved into a subdirectory to simplify adding other files in
the future.

If desired, you may continue to place static files in the same location
they were previously.  Simply copy or link all the items in the "files"
directory into place.

Otherwise, symlink the "files" directory as directed in the README.  You
may remove the *.css files that were copied in previous installations,
as they are no longer used by the standard templates.

In either case, you need to edit the config.py file, and replace the
CSSPREFIX setting with a FILESPREFIX setting.  The value should remain
unchanged if you copied the files over individually as was done
previously.  Otherwise it will need to contain the subdirectory name
created above.
