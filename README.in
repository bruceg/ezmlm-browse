ezmlm-browse
Web browser for ezmlm-idx archives

Version @VERSION@
@TODAY@

This is ezmlm-browse, a web interface for browsing ezmlm-idx (version
0.40 or later) archives.  The presentation is modeled from that of the
ezmlm-cgi archive browser that is part of ezmlm-idx, but with several
additions.  However, the output is completely template drive, so you can
make it fit into your current web scheme.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Development versions of @PACKAGE@ are available via Subversion at:
	svn://bruce-guenter.dyndns.org/@PACKAGE@/trunk

Requirements:

- Python (tested with 1.5.2, should work with any later version)
- ezmlm 0.53 + idx 0.40 or later.  If you are using an older version of
  ezmlm-idx, you MUST upgrade and run the "ezmlm-idx" command on all
  lists you wish to browse.

Installation:

- Unpack ezmlm-browse into a non-web-visible directory.
- Set conf-home to the directory from which ezmlm-browse will execute.
- Run "make" to build ezmlm-browse and precompile the Python bytecode.
- Either copy the "wrapper" program or symlink the "index.cgi" script
  into your web tree as a CGI.
- If necessary, make the wrapper setuid to whatever user owns the
  mailing list archive files.

Configuration:

- Edit config.py to declare which mailing lists are visible to the web.

Security Notes:

- You will need to choose one of the following options:

  - Make your mailing list archives readable to the UID that the web
    server operates under.  This will likely allow anybody on your
    system to read the contents of the mailing lists, including the
    unfiltered header lines (which include full email addresses, etc.)

  - Make the wrapper CGI program owned by the mailing list archive owner
    and setuid.  If I have not been adequately careful, this may allow
    an attacker to execute code as that user.

  - Use the Apache su-exec module.
