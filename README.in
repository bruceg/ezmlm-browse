ezmlm-browse
Web browser for ezmlm-idx archives
Bruce Guenter <bruce@untroubled.org>
Version @VERSION@
@TODAY@

This is ezmlm-browse, a web interface for browsing ezmlm-idx (version
0.40 or later) archives.  The presentation is modeled from that of the
ezmlm-cgi archive browser that is part of ezmlm-idx, but with several
additions.  However, the output is completely template driven, so you
can make it fit into your current web scheme.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Development versions of @PACKAGE@ are available via Subversion at:

Requirements:

- Python 2 (tested with 2.3, should work with version 2.2 or later)
- ezmlm 0.53 + idx 0.40 or later.  If you are using an older version of
  ezmlm-idx, you MUST upgrade and run the "ezmlm-idx" and
  "ezmlm-archive" commands on all lists you wish to browse.
- bglibs to compile the wrapper program.

Building:

- Unpack ezmlm-browse into a non-web-visible directory.  This is the
  directory from which ezmlm-browse will execute.

- Make sure all the conf-* files have values appropriate for your
  system (they contain notes about what they are used for).

- If your python program is not in the path, put the full path to it in
  the "auto-python" file.

- Run "make" to build "wrapper" and precompile the Python bytecode.

Installation:

- If necessary, make the "wrapper" program setuid to whatever user has
  read access to the mailing list archive files.  Do *NOT* make any
  Python script setuid.

- Symlink either "wrapper" or "browse.cgi" into a location where CGI
  programs may be executed.  Usually this is either something in a
  "cgi-bin" directory or a file elsewhere named "something.cgi".  The
  destination name does not need to be either "wrapper" or "browse.cgi"
  as the script will automatically determine its own name for the links
  it creates.

- Symlink the "files" directory into a web-visible directory, and make
  note of that location for the configuration below.  The visible name
  does not need to remain as "files".

Configuration:

- Edit config.py to declare which mailing lists are visible to the web,
  and set the other defaults as appropriate (most notably, the web path
  to the "files" directory installed above should go in FILESPREFIX).

- Mailing lists should have the ezmlm-make "-i" option enabled to keep
  the necessary indices up to date.  If this is not enabled, run the
  following command for each list:

	ezmlm-make -+ -i /path/to/list

Security Notes:

- You will need to choose one of the following options:

  - Make your mailing list archives readable to the UID that the web
    server operates under.  This will likely allow anybody on your
    system to read the contents of the mailing lists, including the
    unfiltered header lines (which include full email addresses, etc.)

  - Make the wrapper CGI program owned by the mailing list archive owner
    and setuid.  If I have not been adequately careful, this may allow
    an attacker to execute code as that user.

  - Use the Apache su-exec module.
